{"OSCE_Examination": {"Patient_Actor": {"Demographics": "45-year-old female, high school teacher", "History": "The patient presents with a 7-month history of persistent and progressive tiredness, which she describes as feeling 'drained' and 'running on empty' most days. The onset was insidious. She attributes her symptoms to her demanding job, recent curriculum changes causing increased work stress, and 'not getting any younger.' She explicitly denies feeling sad or depressed, stating, 'I have a good life, I'm just physically exhausted.' However, on further questioning, she admits to feeling more irritable lately and having less patience with her family and students. Sleep has become problematic; she finds it difficult to initiate sleep and often wakes in the morning feeling as tired as when she went to bed, despite reporting 7-8 hours of sleep. Her appetite has been 'off,' and she notes an unintentional weight loss of approximately 3kg over the past few months, which she attributes to 'not having the energy to cook proper meals.' She mentions her usual hobbies, like gardening and participating in a book club, 'don't seem as appealing' anymore because she's 'too tired to bother.'", "Symptoms": {"Primary_Symptom": "Persistent tiredness and chronic fatigue", "Secondary_Symptoms": ["Difficulty concentrating ('mental fog')", "Unrefreshing sleep", "Diffuse muscle aches", "Occasional mild headaches", "Reduced enjoyment in usual activities", "Increased irritability"]}, "Past_Medical_History": "Seasonal allergic rhinitis.
