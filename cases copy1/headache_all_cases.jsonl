This headache does not typically limit her activities, though she feels fatigued by it and sometimes experiences mild sensitivity to light. The second type occurs 2-3 times per month, presenting as a severe, throbbing headache, often starting on the right side of her head, rated 8-9/10. These episodes are accompanied by intense nausea, occasional vomiting, and marked sensitivity to both light and sound, forcing her to lie down in a dark, quiet room for several hours, sometimes up to a day. These severe headaches are sometimes preceded by 'shimmering zigzag lines' in her vision for about 20 minutes. She notes a possible link between these severe headaches and her menstrual cycle. She is very anxious about a brain tumor as her paternal aunt had one.
