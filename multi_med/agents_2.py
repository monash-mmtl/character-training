    - If doctor requests "lipid studies", look for descriptions containing "cholesterol" or "triglycerides"
    
    CRITICAL: You MUST parse multiple tests as separate items. For example:
    - If doctor requests "Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), cortisol level, TSH, urinalysis, and an ECG"
      You should provide results for each test separately:
      "Complete Blood Count: [result]. COST: $16.95
